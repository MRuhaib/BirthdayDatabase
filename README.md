# BirthdayDatabase
Project to be done as part of the training for E-Cell WebOps

This currently isn't really an API to be honest, more of a simple tool (with practically no frontend) to manipulate the database's contents (whose entries consist of a person's name and their birthday :))
Maybe you can download it and run it on localhost? 

127.0.0.1:3000/viewAll  -- shows the entire contents of the database
127.0.0.1:3000/viewOne  -- shows the birthday for a specific name
127.0.0.1:3000/addBday  -- allows you to add an entry
127.0.0.1:3000/deleteBday -- allows you to delete an entry
127.0.0.1:3000/updateBday -- allows you to update an entry
